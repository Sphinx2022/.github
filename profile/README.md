# Sphinx 2022

This is the project done for the [NOI Hackathon in Schenna - 2022](https://hackathon.bz.it/), precisely for the **FOS Group's challenge**.

## The challenge 

The challenge consisted in developing embedded software that supported low-energy bluetooth communication, with the challenge, not so relevant, example of sending photos sent by an ESP32.

## A bit of history

After having decided an approach to follow for the Lifeware's challenge, consisting in using machine learning (regression algs.) to determine an equation from input / outputs. Because the team did not have huge experience with AI, after some attempts the team decided to pass to the FOS challenge. Even if some aspects could not be faced in detail due to the reduced amount of time, a prototype with a simple behaviour has been developed.

## The software

The repos of the software are: 
- [**esp32-high-level**](https://github.com/Sphinx2022/esp32-high-level): It is 
- [**esp32-optimized-entwurf**](https://github.com/Sphinx2022): It is
- [**sphinx-app**](https://github.com/Sphinx2022/sphinx-app): A simple app developed with **Flutter**, by using a template since the frontend was not considered important
