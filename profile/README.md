# Sphinx 2022

This is the project done for the [NOI Hackathon in Schenna - 2022](https://hackathon.bz.it/), precisely for the **FOS Group's challenge**.

## The challenge 

The challenge consisted in developing embedded software that supported low-energy bluetooth communication, with the challenge, not so relevant, example of sending photos sent by an ESP32.
